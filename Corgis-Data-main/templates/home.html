	This website explores relationships with SAT Scores such as 
	"What gender has better scores", "Which class year had the best score", and "What is the average score for a student in a specific state or in the U.S."
	The Graph used data from the json file called <a href="https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/json/"> School Scores JSON File</a>
	made by Corgis JSON data sets. However this dataset does report specific data for students of race, certain ethnicities, 
	or have special needs like dyslexia. 
	Yet, we learned some facts like the the Class of 2006 had the highest average SAT Score of 1518 
	according to <a href="https://blog.prepscholar.com/average-sat-scores-over-time"> Prep Scholar</a>, and
	males scored better than females according to the  
	<a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d19/tables/dt19_226.20.asp"> National Center for Education Statistics</a>.
